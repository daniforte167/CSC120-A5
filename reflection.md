- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
It makes a big difference because everything is even more connected so I feel like it was a lot of backtracking. It kind of feels like dominoes or something like if you move a single domino out of line, then it won't reach the rest so the design or line of dominoes isn't perfect/isn't working right.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I had a hard time bringing the banner and the boots in; I couldn't figure out how to bring them both in or make them work, if I tried it one way it said "undefined" but when I changed the boots name in the command line it would just print "right" and "left" but that was the only way the entire line wasn't red. For the baanner I finally got it working but I don't know how to bring it in. I don't know what advice to give other than make sure to get a second pair of eyes on it because I'm sure if I had time to get some help they would've been able to help me put the pieces together.
